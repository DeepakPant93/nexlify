# Nexlify
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based AI chatbot integrated with GitHub Copilot.

This repository contains three projects:

1. [data-ingestion-server](./data-ingestion-server/README.md)  
   For data ingestion into the vector database.

2. [nexlify-ai-agentics-server](./nexlify-ai-agentics-server/README.md)  
   For the Agentic AI server, which queries the vector database using the data ingestion service and browses the internet.

3. [nexlify-mcp-server](./nexlify-mcp-server/README.md)  
   The MCP server to connect your AI client, such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT, to the AI server.

For more in-depth information on each component, please consult their individual README files located in the directories linked above. To explore Nexlify further, check out the [Nexlify Docs](docs/README.md).
